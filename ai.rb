  # specified player and the current board cell configuration. It examines every
  # possible move that could be made, all the way up to a terminal state of the
  # game - one that results in a win, a loss, or a tie. Once in a terminal state,
  # an arbitrary score is assigned - a positive score (+10) for a win, a
  # negative score (-10) for a loss, or a neutral score (0) for a tie. With this
  # approach, a sequence that takes five turns to win or lose will have the same
  # score as a sequence that takes one turn. Since it is desired to be ruthless
  # and win as soon as possible (or fight to the bitter end), a winning sequence
  # (from the AI player's perspective) will have the number of turns subtracted
  # from its score. Similarly, a losing sequence will have the number of turns
  # added to its score. This method is recursive, with each call representing
  # each player's turn. Once all moves are scored for a turn, the highest score
  # is chosen if it's this AI player's turn. The lowest score is chosen if it's
  # the opponent's turn (i.e the best move for the opponent).
