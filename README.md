# Tic-Tac-Toe

Part of the Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming). This assignment uses Sinatra, Ruby, Javascript, JQuery, and HTML to build a web application: a tic-tac-toe game where you play against the computer. See the live version [here](https://immense-garden-51672.herokuapp.com).
